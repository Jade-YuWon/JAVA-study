# JAVA
'WORA' (Write Once, Run Anywhere)<br>
Platform-independent High-Level Programming Language

## Basic
### IDE
- __Eclipse__
   - install: www.eclipse.org
- IntellijJ Idea
- NetBeans
### Java Edition
- Java JRE(for implementation) + JDK(for development)
  - __Java SE__
  - Java SE
  - Java SE
 - JDK (it includes JRE)
   - __Oracle JDK__
   - install: www.oracle.com/java
   - Open JDK (Open source and Oracle JDK based)
### JAVA Program
1. Java Application
2. Java Applet
3. Java Servlet
### JVM
Java is a Platform-independent Language because of the support of JVM(Java Virtual Machine).
__JVM__ is a system software that interprets byte codes and implements it.
Byte code is independent to Hardware-based platform.
(__JVM__ is __not__ independent to Hardware-based platform.)
- Comparison with general high-level language
1. General program source code -> Compiler -> Binary Code -> OS, Hardware
1. JAVA program source code(_Hello.java_) -> Compiler -> Byte Code(_Hello.class_) -> __JAVA Platform__ -> OS, Hardware
-  __JAVA Platform__ = JVM + API : The Java platform arbitrate between OS&Hardware and Byte codes.
    - JVM for Windows -> Implementation file for Windows -> Window PC
    - JVM for Linux -> Implementation file for Linux -> Linux PC
    - JVM for Mac -> Implementation file for Mac -> Macintosh
    - (Repeatedly, __JVM__ is __not__ independent to Hardware-based platform.)
### Java Command
- java.exe
- javac.exe
-
